On this bay is a mighty headland, facing the east, called Syagros, at which there are a fortress to guard the region, a harbor, and a storehouse for the collection of frankincense. In the open sea off it is an island, between it and the Promontory of Spices across the water but nearer to Syagros, called Dioscurides; though very large, it is barren and also damp, with rivers, crocodiles, a great many vipers, and huge lizards, so huge that people eat the flesh and melt down the fat to use in place of oil. The island bears no farm products, neither vines nor grain. The inhabitants, few in number, live on one side of the island, that to the north, the part facing the mainland; they are settlers, a mixture of Arabs and Indians and even some Greeks, who sail out of there to trade. The island yields tortoise shell, the genuine, the land, and the light-colored, in great quantity and distinguished by rather large shields, and also the oversize mountain variety with an extremely thick shell, of which the parts over the belly, whichever are useful, do not take [sc. regular] cutting; besides, they are rather tawny. On the other hand, whatever can be used for small boxes, small plaques, small disks, and similar items gets cut up completely. The so-called Indian cinnabar is found there; it is collected as an exudation from the trees.</p> <p>31. The island is subject to the aforementioned king of the frankincense- bearing land, just as Azania is to Charibael and the governor of Mapharitis. Trade with it used to be carried on by some of the shippers from Muza and also by those sailing out of Limyrike and Barygaza who by chance put in at it; these would exchange rice, grain, cotton cloth, and female slaves, which found a market because of a shortage there, for big cargoes of tortoise shell. At the present time the kings have leased out the island, and it is under guard.</p> </div> </article> </div> </main> <footer id="site-footer"> <div class="container"> <div class="h5 pt-4">Foreign Merchants of Socotra</div> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-lg-3"> <ul class="list-unstyled"> <li class="text-secondary"> Foreign Merchants of Socotra </li> <li><a href="mailto:pcb281@nyu.edu">pcb281@nyu.edu</a></li> </ul> </div> <div class="col-12 col-lg"> <p class="text-secondary text-justify">During the early first millennium CE the island of Socotra, off the coasts of Yemen and Somalia, was a hubb of traders from all corners of the Indian Ocean.
